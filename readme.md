fairyMQ is an open-source UDP based message queue software written in GO.  fairyMQ is in-memory, secure, extremely fast and super simple.


## Setup
**************
fairyMQ expects a keypair per queue.  When sending messages to fairy the messages must be encrypted with the queues public key.
fairy will try all available keys to decrypt a message before failing.  Upon successful encryption fairy knows which queue to access.

``` 
./fairymq --generate-queue-key-pair example
```
